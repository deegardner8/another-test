                    <h2>
                        PUERTO MORELOS
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        It is the northernmost town in the so-called Riviera Maya. It is located 16 
                        km south of the Cancun International Airport and 32 kilometers south of the 
                        city of Cancun.
                        Like many other coastal towns and cities, Puerto Morelos was born as the 
                        center of activity for local fishermen. Without detaching itself from its 
                        origins, today it is positioned among the classic destinations of the Riviera 
                        Maya as a more than interesting option.Unlike Cancun and Playa del Carmen, 
                        here you can enjoy a relaxed atmosphere and a lot of tranquility in the middle 
                        of beautiful beaches that guarantee spend unforgettable days by the sea.
                        The coastal population has a varied offer of hotels and restaurants with 
                        cheap prices and low density. To the north and south of the town there are 
                        just over five thousand rooms in grand resort type hotels. Off the coast of 
                        Puerto Morelos is the Arrecife de Puerto Morelos National Park, a protected 
                        natural area whose shallow barrier reef is located a very short distance from 
                        the beaches. Due to the low waves, the place is ideal for windsurfing, 
                        snorkeling and diving.

                    <h2>
                        SAN MIGUEL
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        The oldest known vestiges of human occupation on the Island date from the 
                        early years of the Christian Era and are attributed to occasional settlements 
                        by nomadic groups from the Caribbean. The colonizing group of Cozumel made the 
                        Island an important commercial point and gave it its cultural stamp, highlighting 
                        two points: the implantation of the cult of Ixchel, mother goddess, patron of 
                        weaving, fertility, pregnancy and childbirth, identified with the Moon, making 
                        the Island its main sanctuary and the assignment of the toponym that although 
                        deformed still identifies the Island. Originally the Mayan name was Cuzaam luumil, 
                        by apocope it became Cuzamil and by phonetic deformation, the Hispanics transformed 
                        it into Cozumel that we currently use. Etymologically the toponymic can be divided 
                        as follows: Cuzam: swallow; Luum: land or place and IL: of belonging to. Literally 
                        it can therefore be translated as place or land of swallows.

                    <h2>
                        PLAYA DEL CARMEN
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        In pre-Hispanic times Playa del Carmen was called Xaman Há (in Mayan language: Xaman 
                        Ha ', ‘Agua del Norte’)? and it was a starting point for the Mayans on their pilgrimage 
                        to the sanctuary of Ixchel in Cozumel. The first modern settlement dates from the early
                        twentieth century, when a community of fishermen, coconut and gum tree producers settled 
                        there. [Citation needed]
                        
                        During the 16th century the Spanish invaded and conquered most of the Mayan sites. However, 
                        unlike many others, Playa del Carmen never became a Spanish settlement. [Citation needed] 
                        With the arrival of the Spanish in Mexico, it is recorded that Francisco de Montejo was 
                        the one who conquered this region in 1526, founding the town from Salamanca where Xel-Ha 
                        is currently located. Also, a year later, a Montejo lieutenant, Alonso Dávila, established 
                        his camp in Xaman-Ha, which he described as a fishing village. Despite these events, this 
                        area remained very sparsely inhabited throughout the colonial period.
                        
                        The founding of Playa del Carmen was due to a chicle company on the eastern coast of Yucatán, 
                        which in 1908 obtained from the government of Porfirio Díaz the concession to explore forest 
                        resources.
